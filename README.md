# Title: Algebraic Graph Theory for Cryptographic Protocols

Objective: To analyze the spectral and algebraic properties of Cayley graphs, expander graphs, and isogeny graphs for developing cryptographic protocols that are resilient to quantum attacks.

Key Features:

Spectral analysis of graphs for cryptographic strength

Implementation of a graph-based digital signature scheme

Simulation of Grover’s and Shor’s quantum algorithms to test cryptographic resilience

Optimization using parallel computing (Dask) for scalability

This repository serves as a resource for exploring graph-based cryptographic systems, their post-quantum resilience, and advanced algebraic graph structures for secure communication.
